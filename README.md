Cypress test task
=================

Thank you for your interest in joining Fable as QA Analyst. We've prepared a simple test task so you can demonstrate the skills which will be required in the position.

## Setup (requires Node.js)

1. Clone or download a copy of the repo
2. Run `npm install` in the working directory
3. Open Cypress with `./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`

## Test task

Working in `cypress/integration/example_spec.js`:

1. Use **cypress-axe** to do an accessibility scan of the page
2. Write a test which validates that when the form is submitted with an error, an error message shows
3. Leave a comment in the spec file showing the query you would use to find the document in the **companies** collection where the value of the **shortcode** property is "FBL"

## Submitting your work

Please email the `example_spec.js` file to perry@makeitfable.com
